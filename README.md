# Metal Framework

This is a UI design built for Trennds Inc.
It's also a project for GSoC Heat organized by GNU/Linux User's Group, NIT Durgapur.

## Overview
We use **Sass** to compile the **.scss** syntax to **.css** files.
We use **RollUp**  to compile ESM modules into .js files, which transpiles using **Babel** to support all the modern ES6 syntax so that it can be supported by both modern and old browsers.  
We use **Hugo** to setup local development server and build docs file.
